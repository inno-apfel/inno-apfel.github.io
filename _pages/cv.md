------
* B.S. in **Data Science**, University of California, San Diego, 2020-2024
* High School Diploma, Diamond Bar High School, 2016-2020

## Work & Research Experience
------
* **National Power Outages Analysis and Predictor**, University of California San Diego, May 2022 - Present
  * Wrangled large amounts of data, cleaning and transforming features, to discover and visualize interesting trends and patterns within national power outage observations
  * Analyzed unusual discoveries and rigorously evaluated speculations through hypothesis testing
  * Utilized scikit-learn and supervised machine learning techniques to implement a random forest classifier to predict cause categories for major power outages.

* **Instructional Assistant: DSC30 - Data Structures and Algorithms**, HDSI & Jacobs School of Engineering (UC San Diego), April 2022 - Present
  * Collaborated with instructors and 21 other TAs to reinforce student learning of skills and materials through weekly check-ins, informal assessments, and observations
  * Assisted student learning by providing one on one support during weekly office hours
  * Answered 100+ questions through the online class forum
  * Developed multiple comprehensive rubrics for quarterly examinations

* **Open Metaverse Academic Internship**, Arthur C. Clarke Center for Human Imagination, January 2022 - March 2022
  * Developed an interactive VR visualization in Unity game engine stimulating the relaxation effects of meditation to reduce stress, depression, and anxiety
  * Implemented a data pipeline through socket communication to transfer respiration belt data from python API to C in Unity, allowing users to interact with the virtual world through respiration
  * Presented results to program advisors, 28 other teams, and countless interested students to demonstrate the immersive capabilities of virtual reality software

* **KNN Image Classifier and Image Processor**, University of California San Diego,  March 2021
  * Developed a python program to perform image modifications and classifications
  * Implemented basic image manipulation tools such as RGB color scale modifications, image cropping, and image rotation.
  * Implemented a k-nearest neighbors classification algorithm based on RGB euclidean distances to classify images with pre-labeled training data.

* **Jeopardy Analysis**, University of California San Diego, December 2020
  * Performed general analyses on Jeopardy game data, investigating trends in contestant behaviors and the distribution of questions and question difficulties.
  * Utilized hypothesis testing to analyze mid-game trends between winning and losing contestants, giving insight into mid-game factors that increase contestants’ likelihoods of winning
  * Utilized bootstrapping and confidence intervals to compute an amount of winnings, with 99% confidence, that game-hosts should prepare to give out while minimizing losses
