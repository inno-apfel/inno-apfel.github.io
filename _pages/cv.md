<!-- ## Education
------
* B.S. in **Data Science**, University of California, San Diego, 2020-2024
* High School Diploma, Diamond Bar High School, 2016-2020 -->

## Work Experience
------
* **Instructional Assistant: DSC30 - Data Structures and Algorithms**
  <br>
  HDSI & Jacobs School of Engineering (UCSD), April 2022 - June 2022
  * Collaborated with instructors and 21 other TAs to reinforce student learning of skills and materials through weekly check-ins, informal assessments, and observations
  * Assisted student learning by providing one on one support during weekly office hours
  * Answered 100+ questions through the online class forum(piazza) and one on one support
  during weekly office hours
  * Developed multiple comprehensive rubrics for quarterly examinations

* **Software Engineer Intern**
  <br>
  Qualcomm Institute - UC San Diego Division of Calit2, January 2022 - March 2022
  * Developed an interactive VR visualization in the Unity game engine to replicate the effects of meditation for stress, depression, and anxiety reduction.
  * Implemented a data pipeline through socket communication to transfer respiration belt outputs from python API to C# in Unity, allowing users to seemlessly interact with the virtual world through respiration.
  * Presented results to program advisors, 28 other teams, and countless interested students to demonstrate the immersive capabilities of virtual reality software

## Other Projects and Research
------
* **League of Legends Champion Analysis and Recommendation Dashboard**
  <br>
  University of California San Diego, January 2023 - March 2023
  * Developed an interactive dashboard using D3.js, visualizing various facets of League of Legends champions/characters to assist users in discovering new champions to learn/play
  * Introduced a step by step process to narrow down possible champions, based on user preferences and choices, dynamically updating visualizations to only display information on a subset of champions that satisfy those criteria.

* **Personalized Steam Video Game Recommender**
  <br>
  University of California San Diego, September 2022 - December 2022
  * Normalized (json->csv), cleaned, and visualized a dataset of over 4 million implicit user interactions.
  * Scraped video game prices and release dates with BeautifulSoup4 to impute certain missing values.
  * Implemented Bayesian Personalized Ranking and Alternating Least Squares matrix factorization algorithms with the Implicit python library to build collaborative filtering recommender systems.
  * Tuned and finalized an Alternating Least Squares model that correctly identifies whether or not a user owns a randomly chosen game with 89.93% accuracy.
  * Produced a final dashboard allowing users to generate 20 personalized game recommendations filtered by genre tags and release dates.

* **GPT-3/3.5 Text-Based Fantasy RPG Game**
  <br>
  University of California San Diego, September 2022 - December 2022
  * Wrote a python script interfacing users with OpenAI's GPT-3 API, to replicate the text based RPG game experience (Dungeons and Dragons). 
  * Utilized GPT-3 to automatically generate unique responses to player actions, in lieu of having a human "dungeon master" or pre-preprogrammed responses, allowing for unbounded story potential.
  * Implemented various player actions (do, say, see, ...) and menu actions (save/load_game, display_questbook, ...)
  * Crafted customized prompts for each action type in order to harness GPT-3's story telling abilities while limiting it's response scope to a text-based RPG structure. (ChatGPT is now capable of this without any prompt engineering D:)


* **National Power Outages Analysis and Predictor**
  <br>
  University of California San Diego, March 2022 - June 2022
  * Wrangled large datasets(pandas), cleaning and transforming(sklearn) features to discover and visualize(matploblib/seaborn) trends and patterns within national power outage observations
  * Analyzed unusual discoveries and rigorously evaluated speculations through hypothesis testing
  * Utilized scikit-learn and supervised machine learning techniques to implement and optimize a random forest classifier to predict the root cause for major power outages.

* **KNN Image Classifier and Image Processor**
  <br>
  University of California San Diego,  March 2021
  * Developed a python program to perform image modifications and classifications
  * Implemented basic image manipulation tools such as RGB color scale modifications, image cropping, and image rotation.
  * Implemented a k-nearest neighbors classification algorithm based on RGB euclidean distances to classify images with pre-labeled training data.

* **Jeopardy Analysis**
  <br>
  University of California San Diego, December 2020
  * Performed general analyses on Jeopardy game data, investigating trends in contestant behaviors and the distribution of questions and question difficulties.
  * Utilized hypothesis testing to analyze mid-game trends between winning and losing contestants, giving insight into mid-game factors that increase contestantsâ€™ likelihoods of winning
  * Utilized bootstrapping and confidence intervals to compute an amount of winnings, with 99% confidence, that game-hosts should prepare to give out while minimizing losses
