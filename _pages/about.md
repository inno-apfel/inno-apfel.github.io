Hi! I'm a second year undergraduate student majoring in **Data Science** at the [Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu) in **University of California, San Diego**.  I'm interested in getting more hands-on experience working with real world data in data analytics and software engineering. Currently looking for internships in data analytics and software engineering for Summer 2022 / Fall 2022 / Winter 2023 or co-ops!
